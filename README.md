# AutoInventoryManager
In this project, I was expected to develop an application that interacted with Python and SQL. Objectives expected from this project consisted of building at least three tables, importing data into the database using python/SQL, and carrying out data analysis, in addition to explaining the added value of this application once deployed. 
Check documentation file for information and code breakdown.
